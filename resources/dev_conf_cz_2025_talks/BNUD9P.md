## Abstract
                    
This talk will explore a packet journey through the networking stack while making a connection from one pod to another in OpenShift. It's aiming at getting the audience a better understanding about what is happening under the hood and how different concepts come into play (e.g. services or policies).

In order to get visibility into the networking stack and see where packets are flowing, we'll use a recently created networking visibility tool: Retis. While the presentation is not about the tool itself, examples will be shown and attendees can expect to get an overview about how Retis can be used for
inspecting the Linux networking stack.

Attending this talk does not require previous knowledge and is an introduction level, although configuring and using OpenShift won't be covered in depth.
