## Abstract
                    
Scaling applications dynamically to meet varying demands can be challenging. OpenShift Serverless addresses this by providing Kubernetes-native building blocks, enabling developers to create and deploy serverless, event-driven applications. Leveraging the open-source Knative project, OpenShift Serverless offers features such as automatic scaling — including the ability to scale down to zero during periods of inactivity — efficient resource utilization, and seamless integration with event sources. This empowers developers to focus on writing code without managing the underlying infrastructure, leading to faster development cycles and reduced operational overhead. In this session, I will showcase how to build a lightweight yet highly scalable application using OpenShift Serverless's Serving and Eventing capabilities. Attendees will gain practical insights and actionable knowledge to leverage serverless technologies for their workloads.
