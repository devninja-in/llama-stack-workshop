## Abstract
                    
With the rise of cloud technologies and distributed data centers, networks are becoming increasingly complex. As a result, there is a constant demand for efficient, reliable, and secure network solutions. For decades, network engineers have been working to manage and optimize networks, exploring how automation can reduce manual effort and minimize downtime. Given the competitive landscape, the growing complexity of use cases, and the rapid advancement of AI, gaining expertise in network automation will position you ahead in the industry—both in knowledge and execution.

Modern networks are considerably complex with 1000-1500 network devices linked together making them equally complex to deal with. In this session, we will explore the importance of taking the first few steps towards managing these complex networks with automation. We’ll discuss where to start, identify key use cases to focus on, and demonstrate how tools like Ansible can help achieve these goals. By the end of this session attendees  will gain practical insights and valuable knowledge on network automation and learn how Ansible can be leveraged to automate network use cases efficiently.
