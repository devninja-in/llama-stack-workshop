## Abstract
                    
Leveraging GatewayAPI, cert-manager, external-dns, and Kong Ingress controller to provide HTTP(S)/GRPC(S) ingress access to services within a Kubernetes cluster in an automated fashion using Kubernetes resource manifests. 

Once configured, we will utilize RBAC and Hierarchical Namespace controller to enforce required namespace labels, which will then be used to secure/configure Ingress hosts and routes in the context of a multi-tenanted cluster.
