## Abstract
                    
This session will guide you through the end-to-end workflow of productizing the Observability Operator using Konflux, a Kubernetes-native, security-first software factory based on Tekton. We’ll showcase the journey from upstream development to the final productized version, highlighting key challenges and lessons learned in the process.

We will compare Konflux with previous tools used in OpenStack, such as DLRN with Zuul as a CI system, discussing their limitations in cloud-native environments. Additionally, we’ll explore how this approach compares to traditional Fedora and Red Hat release tools like Koji, Brew or Errata Tool, and how each fits into the productization pipeline.

By the end of this session, you’ll gain insights into optimizing productization workflows, leveraging modern tools like Konflux, and how it compares to older solutions.
