## Abstract
                    
This workshop teaches you how to use of the popular project kiwi to build images in the same way that we are building them for Fedora and CentOS, but then takes it a step further than just building the base images and guides you through the process we use to build and test those cloud image, including all of the necessary components to run a KDE desktop from a Public cloud provider. Weâ€™ll use the CentOS Stream Hyperscale image build process, add the VDI software provided by Amazon and install it as a part of our image build process.
