## Abstract
                    
In this talk I'll give an overview of how we use and contribute to systemd at Meta. From being an upstream maintainer, streamlining the development process, maintaining the systemd backport in the CentOS Stream Hyperscale SIG and rolling out new releases internally across the fleet. We'll take a look at the full journey systemd takes from upstream to finally end up on Meta's servers.
