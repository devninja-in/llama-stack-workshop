## Abstract
                    
Go templates are a powerful feature which allow Go developers to generate Go code from existing Go code [mind blowing!]. In our talk we will show how we have used this powerful feature to create a dedicated compiler which generates powerful SDKs for our services and tooling. We will describe the evolving feature set that were created over time and discuss the technical challenges and complexities that we faced in designing developing this compiler.
