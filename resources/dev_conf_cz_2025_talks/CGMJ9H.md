## Abstract
                    
The open source landscape is vast and rich in interesting content, as well as the ecosystem where many projects have evolved into fully-fledged products known to us all and at enterprise level.

Its fascination can drive all of us at some point in our careers to want to contribute on an ongoing or sporadic basis to these projects or start our one, giving back a little of what the community has given us for our work, home lab or weekend fun.

In this lightning talk I would like to pique your curiosity by talking about the reasons for contributing or starting a project, myths to dispel and bring a concrete example of how a Sunday project can unknowingly become something surprisingly useful to others.
