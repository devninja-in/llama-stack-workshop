## Abstract
                    
AI is revolutionizing DevSecOps by enabling faster, smarter security automation. This lightning talk dives into how open-source AI-powered tools like DeepFence ThreatMapper and Trivy can detect vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance risks across container images, IaC, and runtime environments before deployment.

Attendees will learn:
1. How AI enhances security analysis in DevSecOps workflows.
2. Automating security and compliance checks with AI-powered tools.
3. Integrating AI-driven threat detection into CI/CD pipelines.

By the end of this session, youâ€™ll gain practical insights on leveraging AI for proactive security enforcement, shifting security left, and minimizing risks in cloud-native environments
