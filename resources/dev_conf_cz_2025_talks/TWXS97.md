## Abstract
                    
As modern applications adopt cloud-native architectures, testing must evolve to keep up. In this presentation we'll explore how Testkube, an open-source framework, streamlines testing workflows in Kubernetes environments. We'll discover how it integrates seamlessly with popular testing tools, how it fits naturally into CI/CD pipelines, and how its declarative configurations aligns with GitOps principles. Additionally, we'll examine the benefits of centralized test reporting and how it helps to tackle scalability issues. This session will offer practical insights and real-world examples from enterprise environments.
