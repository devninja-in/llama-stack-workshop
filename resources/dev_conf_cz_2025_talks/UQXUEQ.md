## Abstract
                    
Kids love music, and love making music.  Sheet music is hard for kids to read.  Chromatic is a small hobby project for printing out music in a colorful simplified kid-friendly notation which pairs nicely with widely-available stickers that you can stick to many instruments.

GitHub is proprietary software.  I attended an excellent talk at FOSDEM this year from the Software Freedom Conservancy crew about how we should all be using free alternatives, which started me down the path of exploring Forƒùejo and Codeberg as potential platforms for developing the Cockpit project (my day job).  Chromatic was an ideal test project.  It was already a couple of weeks old when I attended FOSDEM, but on the train ride home, I made the "Initial commit" and pushed it to Codeberg.

This is a story about music, math, colour theory, and rediscovering the importance of using Free software to create Free Software.  We'll briefly explore Codeberg and Forƒùejo, and their feature set compared to GitHub.
