## Abstract
                    
While large language models dominate AI conversations, Small Language Models (SLMs) are proving to be powerful, efficient and more practical for many real-world applications.

In this Lightning Talk, weâ€™ll explore what small Language Models are and how they work. We will see how they compare to their larger counterparts and the advantages they offer in terms of cost, speed, and accessibility. Lastly, we will go through a few real world use cases where SLMs can be used effectively.

This talk would be useful for developers, AI enthusiasts and beginners to know more about the SLMs, their use cases and why they are gaining traction.
