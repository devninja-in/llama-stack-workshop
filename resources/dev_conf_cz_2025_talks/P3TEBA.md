## Abstract
                    
This talk will discuss how we ported CentOS Stream to Apple Silicon Macs by leveraging the existing work in Fedora Asahi Remix and the Asahi Linux project, together with the tooling provided by the CentOS project, the CentOS Hyperscale SIG and the CentOS Alternative Images SIG. We'll talk about challenges, progress, contribution avenues and close with a quick demo.
