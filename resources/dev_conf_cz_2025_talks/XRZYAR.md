## Abstract
                    
The AI/ML lifecycle involves multiple stages, from data preparation to model deployment, each with its own set of challenges. This talk will explore use cases where AIOps has streamlined the AI/ML lifecycle,, enabling faster experimentation and deployment. We'll present a cloud-based solution architecture using tools like MLflow, Kubernetes, and cloud-native services (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Openshift AI). The demo will showcase an end-to-end AIOps pipeline, including data versioning, model training, deployment, and monitoring with a focus on integrating LLMs and AI agents into production workflows.
