## Abstract
                    
In this talk, I will show enriched with pictures the whole process of opening and reversing a WiFi lamp which was previously configured and working.
I will start with how to open the device, identifying the chip, how to connect to it, then I will show how I extracted the firmware, reversed a bit of it,  and how I got sensitive information related with the last time it was used.
Final goal is awareness of our digital information and how to get rid of cheap electronics.
