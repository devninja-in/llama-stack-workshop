## Abstract
                    
Is your team drowning in alerts and struggling to maintain focus during critical incidents? In this session, we’ll illustrate how AIOps can transform the entire incident lifecycle–from intelligent alerting to faster resolution and insightful postmortems.

We’ll share real-world examples, including how one global retailer reduced alert noise by 60% using advanced correlation techniques and slashed its Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) by 30%. You’ll learn how to set meaningful thresholds, group related alerts, and leverage AI to generate clear, real-time incident updates, freeing you to solve issues instead of writing status emails.

Finally, we’ll explore how AI-generated postmortems can spark a culture of continuous improvement. Walk away with concrete strategies, common pitfalls to avoid, and an actionable roadmap to implement AIOps in your organization. This talk is ideal for DevOps engineers, SREs, and IT leaders seeking to reduce alert fatigue and build more resilient services.
