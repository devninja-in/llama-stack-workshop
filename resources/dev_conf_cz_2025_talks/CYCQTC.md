## Abstract
                    
It's 2AM in China and a critical fix was just released by a team mate based in the US. Lin, the quality engineer of the team, is up late night running regression tests to ensure that we can release the patch to customers the following day. Does this sound familiar?  

Every day, engineers make critical decisions in the middle of the night, or wait 24 hours for code reviews or miss vital context from a meeting happening during their family time. All of this has a real cost, hours lost in productivity, delayed releases, and talented team members who quietly burn out.

Drawing form hard-earned experience leading teams across 3 continents, I'll highlight the visible and hidden costs of distributed teams as well as discuss possible strategies to better align team structures.
