## Abstract
                    
In this session, I'll introduce Quarkus Security architecture from a Spring developer perspective. I'll show how to configure, develop and test Quarkus application secured with OpenId Connect. Quarkus Security team is focused on a Developer Joy, and I'll show how the latest features like Dev Services for OIDC allow users to start right way, with zero configuration and literally no waiting for OIDC server to start. Then we will take existing Spring Boot application and migrate it to Quarkus in 20 minutes, with focus on security aspects. This way, you will learn how Spring and Quarkus security concepts compare next to each other.
