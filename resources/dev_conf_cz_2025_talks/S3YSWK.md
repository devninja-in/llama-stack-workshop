## Abstract
                    
KubeVirt brings the power of virtual machines to Kubernetes, but its complexity can pose challenges for new users. This talk focuses on recent improvements to two essential tools: virtctl, the CLI for managing KubeVirt resources, and the kubevirt.core Ansible collection, designed for automating virtual machine operations. These enhancements introduce features that simplify workflows, enhance usability, and make managing virtual machines on Kubernetes more approachable.

Weâ€™ll explore how these tools streamline tasks like managing the virtual machine lifecycle in conjunction with instancetypes and leveraging existing Ansible automation content to reduce manual effort. Attendees will discover how these improvements make KubeVirt more accessible and practical. This session is ideal for Kubernetes enthusiasts, DevOps, and virtualization engineers looking to integrate hybrid workloads into their cloud-native environments.
