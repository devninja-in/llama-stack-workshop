## Abstract
                    
When we talk about accessibility, most people think about screen readers or wheelchair ramps. But what about people with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, or anxiety? Their challenges are different, but just as important. Neurological UX focuses on making digital experiences easy and comfortable for all kinds of minds.

In this talk, we will explore how small design changes—like reducing clutter, using simple language, and adding clear navigation—can make apps, websites, and products more user-friendly for neurodivergent people. The best part? These changes don’t just help a few; they make life easier for everyone.

Let’s rethink UX, not just for the eyes, but for the brain too.
