## Abstract
                    
Agile transformations happen again and again, yet few truly succeed. Why? Because we often focus on theory over reality, tools over mindset, and frameworks over actual value. Many organizations appoint Agile leaders without fully understanding what Agile is, and then struggle to measure success, often replacing leaders before real impact can be seen.

This talk is for leaders, Agile practitioners, and teams struggling with real transformation challenges. We will cut through the noise and discuss what really matters: delivering value, engaging people, and recognizing early warning signs that you’re heading in the wrong direction. Whether you’re in the middle of a transformation or just getting started, this session will challenge your thinking and provide actionable insights to get Agile working for you—not just as a framework, but as a real driver of success.

Join this talk if you’re tired of transformations that go nowhere—and want to actually make Agile work.
