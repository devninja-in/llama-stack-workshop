## Abstract
                    
"Every generation brings new energy to the workplace. The challenge isn’t adapting to them but evolving with them."
Anuj and I have observed batch after batch of Gen Z interns happily sharing the goodies and perks we get at work on LinkedIn and Instagram. It doesn't just stop there, we also saw them celebrate the successes of their colleagues by hyping them up on social media very openly. It just feels so natural and authentic to them. Our approach on the other hand was generally more reserved. Many of us joined the workforce during or after the 2008 financial crisis, which likely influenced a more cautious approach to workplace sharing.

Generation Z is changing the workplace with their focus on technology, meaningful jobs, honest communication, and the need for flexible schedules. However, many leaders need help to connect with this generation, which can lead to problems in communication, working together, and keeping them engaged. Leaders should focus on building connections to manage Gen Z effectively instead of trying to control them.

As leaders—whether managers or tech leads—working with teams from multiple generations, we will share our experiences and insights on how to adapt to Gen Z’s strengths: their digital-first approach, desire for meaningful work, focus on growth, and the necessity to rethink traditional methods.

This talk will explore strategies for managers and tech leads to connect with and support Gen Z employees. How can you align their values with your company’s goals? What do teamwork and creativity look like when individuals from different generations collaborate? Furthermore, how can leaders use Gen Z’s unique strengths to contribute to the success of their teams?
