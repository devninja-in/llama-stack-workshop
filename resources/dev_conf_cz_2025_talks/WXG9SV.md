## Abstract
                    
When your project rocks, an avalanche of features requests will descend upon you . While you won’t be able to answer all needs, you can help by making everyone happy with plugins.

Due to the high maintenance costs, projects like KubeVirt [1] have either refused these external customization requests or put them on hold. In this presentation, we will explain how we enabled anyone and everyone to create their own networking solution by making KubeVirt networking plugable and user-friendly.

If you’re working on a big and complex Kubernetes [2] based project, you will learn how to identify, plan and implement pluggable functionalities.
