## Abstract
                    
In a world increasingly impacted by regulations, control and compliance - there is a very clear risk in how Open Source innovates and delivers. But more importantly Open Source contributors need to be aware of the impact from these regulations and what it means to their projects, their products and most importantly to them.

In this session we will dive into what the whole Regulated and Sovereign context means, and the impact it has on us. Will AI help or hinder this ? What tools are available to make things easier ?

Keep in mind that regulations are not only Geo Politically driven, they can also be industry specific and individual company CISO enforced! Its increasingly hard to avoid this!
