## Abstract
                    
I'm doing my best to use decentralized, private and censorship resistant tools for development daily. Some stuff just works, some is a bit..meh:). Let me walk you through a bunch of open source projects I especially value for their hard work, commitment to open source and focus on privacy and censorship-resistance.

I'll explain and demo projects like Radicle, Fileverse, Status, Akash Network, Drips Network, Continue Dev... which allow you to "escape" the centralized dev tool world.
