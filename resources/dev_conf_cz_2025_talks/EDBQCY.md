## Abstract
                    
This talk is all about Generative UI. AI-driven user interfaces that actually adapt to users in real time. No more static, one-size-fits-all UIs. Weâ€™re talking about apps that think, respond, and evolve based on what users need.

But hereâ€™s the catch: if youâ€™re still building UIs like itâ€™s 2020, you might be in trouble. Weâ€™ll dig into why modular designs (like Micro-Frontends) are the key to making AI-ready web apps, what skills frontend devs need to pick up right now, and how to work with AI instead of getting left behind.
