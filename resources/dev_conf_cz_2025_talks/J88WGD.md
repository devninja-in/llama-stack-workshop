## Abstract
                    
Have you built your Quarkus application and would like to learn how to secure it ? Do you have questions about your existing Quarkus Security solution ? Join Quarkus Security contributor Michal Vavrik to learn about Quarkus security architecture and how to apply its key features. During this lab, Michal will work with you to build a secure Quarkus application, answer your questions and help with:

Configuring, applying, and combining authentication mechanisms. We will use OpenId Connect (OIDC) authorization code flow and Basic authentication during the lab.
Combining two or more well-known OIDC or OAuth2 providers and using one of many available Quarkus OIDC tenant resolution options to choose the right provider for verifying the current request.
Customizing the current security identity before the authorization constraints are applied to it.
Enforcing Role-based access control with a `@RolesAllowed` annotation.
Enforcing Permission-based access control with `@PermissionAllowed` and `@PermissionChecker` annotations.
Learning about HTTP security policies.
Implementing OIDC access token propagation with a single `@AccessToken` annotation.
Using Quarkus TLS registry to support HTTPS.

You will be well informed about and better prepared to work with Quarkus Security after the lab. Not a Quarkus user ? No problems, come along and see how it compares to other framework security implementations you are familiar with.
