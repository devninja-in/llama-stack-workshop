## Abstract
                    
The RHEL crypto team participates in a development effort to add PKCS#11 support into existing cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL and GnuTLS. The PKCS#11 API allows to access a hardware or software security module to perform cryptographic operations. We will explore the topic of PKCS#11 providers and their benefits. Then we will take a closer look at GnuTLS, its cryptographic backend and current development of its PKCS#11 provider. At the end a demo will be presented that shows GnuTLS's PKCS#11 provider in action.
