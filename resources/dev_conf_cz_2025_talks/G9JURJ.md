## Abstract
                    
Join me on a journey where I successfully integrated Fedora Toolbox with Nix and Home Manager under the Nix Toolbox project, creating a fully reproducible setup for my laptop alongside Fedora Bootable Containers.

With Fedora Bootable Containers, you can manage your base system as code. Additionally, Nix Toolbox allows you to:

* Extend Fedora Toolbox with access to over 100,000 packages from Nixpkgs
* Define your home environment and package configurations as code
* Manage your installed Flatpaks declaratively
* Configure user settings for base system packages in a reproducible way

If time permits, I will also demonstrate how Fedora contributors can leverage Testing Farm to validate their laptop setup in a CI environment.
