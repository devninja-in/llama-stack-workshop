## Abstract
                    
Over seven years, our company has developed over 150 microservices in response to an increasingly unmanageable monolithic architecture. As service owners, teams have taken on full responsibility for developing, testing, and operating their respective microservicesâ€”becoming almost completely autonomous at every stage of the development cycle. This autonomy, however, raises a critical question: how can we prevent the formation of technological silos and an overabundance of architectural diversity? In this presentation, we will share the approach we have adopted to allow teams to continue enjoying the benefits of their autonomy while avoiding excessive information isolation from one another.
