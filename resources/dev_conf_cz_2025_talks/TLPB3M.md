## Abstract
                    
Agile workflows aren’t one-size-fits-all. Our team moved from Scrum to Kanban and shaped it to fit our needs, constantly refining the process as we go. In this talk, we’ll share how we’ve customized it, from structuring our GitHub board to shaping our meeting cadence and rotating Kanban Lead role.
We’ll dive into how tasks move across columns, how retrospectives help us adapt, and the lessons we’ve learned along the way. Expect practical tips on planning, prioritization, labelling, triaging, and - most importantly - the art of asking the right questions to keep work flowing smoothly.
The key takeaway? Agile should work for your team - not the other way around. Join us to see how flexible Kanban keeps us efficient, adaptable, and always improving!
