## Abstract
                    
Contributing to open-source projects is an excellent way to improve your skills, gain real-world experience, and engage with a global developer community. Given the large number of contributors with different backgrounds, having an effective Version Control System such as Git is essential for effective contribution. This hands-on workshop will equip you with the essential Git skills needed to contribute effectively to open-source projects.

We’ll start with core concepts such as repositories, forks, feature branches, commit best practices, and remotes before diving into real-world scenarios like rebasing, merge conflict resolution, interactive commits, and handling pull requests. Additionally, we’ll explore collaborative workflows like feature branching, GitHub discussions, and automated checks for CI/CD.

Whether you’re new to open-source or looking to refine your Git workflow, this workshop will give you the confidence to contribute to projects of any scale. Join us to level up your version control skills and take full advantage of Git’s capabilities!
