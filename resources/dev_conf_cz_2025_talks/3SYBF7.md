## Abstract
                    
How a camera, a raspberry pi, a former engineer, an LLM, and some nasty nasty squirrels worked together to build the ultimate squirrel defense system.

A guided tour of building an AI-driven squirrel detector that will attempt to deter squirrels from stealing bird seed from bird feeders (Narrator: It didn't keep the squirrels away).  I'll walk through how I worked with an LLM to rubber duck implementation and installation ideas.  I'll talk about how I fine tuned an existing lightweight model to focus on recognizing squirrels.  And, I'll describe the actual squirrel deterrent mechanism.  While I expect this to be heavy on technical details, I'm here for calling out my failures along the way.  Let's have fun commiserating about persistent squirrels.
