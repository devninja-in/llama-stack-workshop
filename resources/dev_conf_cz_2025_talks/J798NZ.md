## Abstract
                    
Forklift is an open-source project designed to facilitate the migration of virtual machines (VMs) from platforms such as Red Hat Virtualization (RHV), OpenStack, VMware, and OVA to Kubernetes KubeVirt. This presentation will provide an overview of the migration process, with a specific focus on VMware migrations and the techniques employed by Forklift to minimize downtime during these transitions. Additionally, it will explore the rationale behind selecting specific technologies, highlighting their respective benefits and limitations. The session will conclude by discussing Forklift's current objectives and future goals. After the session, you will have a solid understanding of the Forklift migration workflow, the challenges involved, and the strategic decisions that shape the project https://github.com/kubev2v/forklift.
