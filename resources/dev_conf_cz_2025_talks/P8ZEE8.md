## Abstract
                    
In an era where technology increasingly intersects with healthcare, [Identity](https://git.sofiaritz.com/sofia/identity) is a Free Software project that allows individuals to store their most meaningful memories. In the event of dementia or memory loss, trusted trustees can access these memories, integrating them into dementia and palliative care.

Identity is nearing the release of new features and a comprehensive revamp, alongside exciting collaborations with other organizations, that will bring it closer to being feature-complete and production-ready. These changes will expand its capabilities and strengthen integrations with healthcare systems.

One of the winning projects of [Youth Hacking 4 Freedom](https://yh4f.org) 2024, Identity demonstrates how Free Software can help transform healthcare practices, enhancing well-being and promoting more compassionate, personalized care while prioritizing user control and privacy.
