## Abstract
                    
Transitioning into management comes with a set of challenges that aren’t always obvious at the start. This talk outlines what new managers should expect across three core areas: managing teams, managing individuals, and managing yourself. We’ll discuss how to navigate the nuances of these areas to help you be a successful manager.

We’ll explore issues such as lack of team vision, neglecting leadership development, and hesitating to ask basic questions. We’ll also reflect on the pressures of being a manager and how that can affect your own performance.

Throughout the session, we’ll share real examples of mistakes we made early in our management careers, how we addressed them, and what we learned in the process. We’ve made these mistakes, so you don’t have to.
