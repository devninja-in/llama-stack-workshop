## Abstract
                    
Whether you have a large on-premises OpenShift cluster in a production environment or a small OKD cluster at home for testing and development, adding new nodes can often be a complex, time-consuming, and frustrating task. The process can feel overwhelmingâ€”especially for those managing clusters with limited resources or experience.

But don't despair anymore! With just a few simple steps, you can leverage the power of the oc command-line tool to generate an ISO image that enables seamless, hands-free node deployment, particularly useful when adding several compute instances.

In this talk, you'll discover how this new feature works, how to create and customize your ISO image, and how to use it to automatically scale your cluster with minimal effort. Whether you're an experienced administrator or just getting started, this solution will help you simplify on-premises cluster expansion and reduce operational headaches.
