## Abstract
                    
RamaLama is a new tool for running AI Models locally on your laptop. It makes running AI Boring.  By combining AI and Container technology, RamaLama helps developers immediately get their AI Models running in containers, and then helps them get the containerized AI Models into production.  Either on Edge devices or in Kubernetes clusters.
