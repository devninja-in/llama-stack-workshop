## Abstract
                    
While it is true that quantum computers can provide more computational power than classical computers, they also allow to solve problems in a different manner. And this latter aspect, although interesting by itself, is often overshadowed by the former.

In this talk, I would like to shed some light on it.

Many real-life situations where people might have conflicting interests can be modeled as non-cooperative, multipartite games. Think, for example, of people driving through road-crosses, or competing over resources.

A recent game-theoretic approach [1] has shown that allowing "players" in these games to have access to quantum resources enables 
	- better coordination in joint decisions
	- new Nash equilibria and improved social welfare
	- decrease in cheating strategies, by limiting the access to the quantum resources
	- enhanced privacy, when compared to classical strategies to attain similar improvements.

This translates solving social problems, where people might have conflicting interests, in a better way.
