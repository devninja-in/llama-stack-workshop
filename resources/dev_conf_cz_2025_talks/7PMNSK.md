## Abstract
                    
So I got a reasonably cheap industrial GPU. All was fine except for one thing - it was far too loud to use in a regular PC. Nothing that a replacement fan and a bit of 3D printing canâ€™t fix, right ?

A couple months and a few kilograms of PLA later I can now tell you how to turn code into (3D printed) physical objects!

Oh and that GPU did get a new cooling solution in the end. ;-)
