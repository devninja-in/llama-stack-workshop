## Abstract
                    
Agentic AI seems to be getting a lot of attention. I fell into a trap of digging into it a bit and I'd like to share what I found. 

One framework I particularly liked is called Eliza (no, not the one from 1960s). I'd like to walk you through what I've learnt about AI agents and help you build a simple agent that you can take home (on your laptop). We'll use a state-of-the-art LLM for it's brain and plug it into Telegram, so that we can have a little chat with it.
