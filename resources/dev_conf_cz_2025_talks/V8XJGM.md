## Abstract
                    
With the recent adoption of Podman by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the sandbox space, it has become increasingly important for developers and system administrators to familiarize themselves with its powerful capabilities. Podman is a rootless container engine that enables users to run containers, images, and volumes seamlessly across Linux, Windows, and macOS, offering enhanced security and flexibility in container management.

In this presentation, I will explore five often-overlooked features of Podman that can significantly enhance your container management experience. The talk will start with a brief introduction of Quadlets for declarative systemd configuration and integrations with tools like Cockpit and Ansible. We will also delve into the use of Podman commands such as Auto-Update, Healthcheck and Farm to improve your node management. Additionally, I will cover some new features that will help you with Healthchecks’ log location and log size of your containers and a quick demo with tips on how to make the best of Podman’s shell completion.
