## Abstract
                    
systemd (with lowercase S and D) remains up until this day, both one of the most critical pieces of a system, and the least understood one. This workshop is designed to touch upon the beginner features of systemd and explain how you can use systemd to solve common problems, including some that you didn't even know you had. What problems do you ask? Youâ€™ll have to come and see.
