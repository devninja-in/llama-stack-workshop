## Abstract
                    
Testing Farm is being integrated with Konflux CI to cover functional testing of container images and rpm packages against virtual or bare metal machines. Let's take a look behind the scenes at how Testing Farm is developing a shared Tekton integration pipeline to cover these use cases, and how the team has approached CI testing of the integration pipeline against a Konflux CI instance provisioned for each merge request.

Attendees of this talk will gain insight into how they can build, publish, share and test their Tekton pipelines for Konflux CI.
