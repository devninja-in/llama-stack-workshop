## Abstract
                    
As organizations increasingly adopt containerization, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for orchestrating clusters. However, for many teams, the complexity and overhead of managing a Kubernetes cluster can be daunting. In this talk, we'll explore an alternative approach to container orchestration that leverages Ansible's automation capabilities and Podman's container manager.
We'll discuss how to use Ansible to define and manage containerized applications and services. We'll also dive into the world of Podman, a powerful, lightweight alternative to Docker that provides an easier and more secure way to run containers.
