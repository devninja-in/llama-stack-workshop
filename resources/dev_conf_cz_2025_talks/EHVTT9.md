## Abstract
                    
AI won’t take your job (yet) because building LLM-powered applications is more than just API calls and prompt engineering. It requires thoughtful design, scalable architecture, and a good dose of common sense. In this talk, we’ll break down what actually works when developing LLM-based applications that handle 200M+ text records while staying modular and adaptable. We’ll explore when to use an agentic approach and how to keep things simple. No hype - just real-world insights and battle-tested strategies for making LLMs work in production.
