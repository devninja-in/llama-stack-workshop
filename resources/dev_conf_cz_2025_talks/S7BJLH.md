## Abstract
                    
When doing Open Source development code review is an essential skill, but how do you approach it like an expert? On the Podman project the community approves an average of 200 PR’s per month and has built up a large amount of expertise in reviewing code and would like to share our learnings. 

In this panel discussion, we’ll explore PR reviewing from three perspectives: a beginner just getting started, an experienced reviewer, and a senior expert. Together, they’ll share insights on best practices, common challenges, and strategies for effective feedback. With a mix of pre-planned questions and audience Q&A, this session will provide practical takeaways to improve your PR reviews and level up your collaboration skills.
