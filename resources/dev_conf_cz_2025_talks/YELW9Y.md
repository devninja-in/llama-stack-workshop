## Abstract
                    
End-to-End Workshop with Backstage

In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, maintaining efficiency, scalability, and collaboration is paramount. Backstage, an open platform for building developer portals, addresses these challenges by providing a centralized place for managing infrastructure, services, and documentation. This end-to-end workshop will introduce participants to the core concepts and functionalities of Backstage, equipping them with the knowledge to leverage this platform for enhanced developer productivity.

Participants will gain hands-on experience in:

1. Setting Up and Configuring Backstage: Learn the step-by-step process to get Backstage up and running in your development environment.

2. Creating Templates in Backstage: Discover how to create reusable templates that standardize project setups, ensuring consistency and accelerating the onboarding process for new projects.

3. Creating Plugins for Backstage: Understand the process of developing custom plugins to extend the capabilities of Backstage, tailoring the platform to meet the unique needs of your organization.

4. Creating a Software Catalog in Backstage: Learn how to build and maintain a comprehensive software catalog that provides visibility into all your services, enabling better management and oversight.

5. Exploring Core Features: Manage microservices, integrate CI/CD pipelines, and utilize various plugins for added functionalities.

6. Best Practices for Seamless Developer Experience: Implement service cataloging, technical documentation, and manage software templates to create a smooth and efficient workflow.

By the end of the session, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of how Backstage can transform their development workflow, improve collaboration, and streamline operations.

At Red Hat, we have successfully implemented Backstage through projects like the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) and  Red Hat Experience Platform (RHEP) , where it has streamlined internal workflows and enhanced collaboration across teams. By showcasing these real-world use cases, this workshop provides actionable insights and best practices for developers, team leads, and DevOps professionals looking to adopt Backstage in their own organizations.

This workshop is ideal for software engineers, DevOps professionals, and technical leads looking to optimize their development processes and enhance team collaboration through a powerful and extensible developer portal. Join us to discover how Backstage can be a game-changer for your organization's development practices.
