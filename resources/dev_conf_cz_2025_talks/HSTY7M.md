## Abstract
                    
One of the least-known commands of Podman is `podman kube play`, and it’s fantastic. It works as `kubectl apply` and supports the same objects but doesn’t need a Kubernetes cluster. It supports `Pods`, `Deployments`, `Volumes`, `ConfigMaps`, and many other Kubernetes resources and runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It has some additional features compared to `kubectl`, such as using local images.

This talk will discuss using `podman kube play` and its alter-ego `podman kube generate` to simplify Kubernetes’ first experiences.
