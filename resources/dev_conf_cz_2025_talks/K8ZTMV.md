## Abstract
                    
Why is it so hard to sit down, write out client requirements, and deliver a product that’s 100% satisfying? Why do we so often face additional phases, iterations, and the challenge of growing project scope? In this presentation at the crossroads of UX, PM, and leadership, I’ll delve into the behavioral patterns that make defining requirements such a struggle. This issue is both critical—posing real risks to our projects—and surprisingly common. Drawing on Tesler’s Law and Tog’s Paradox, I’ll explore their insights on user-product interaction and share strategies you can use to regain control over your projects.
