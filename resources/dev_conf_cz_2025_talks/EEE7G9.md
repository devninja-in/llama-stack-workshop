## Abstract
                    
Commit, push, merge - you already know this much. But Git has a lot more up its sleeve!
Is your code scattered across multiple repositories? Is the size of your project starting to hinder your work? Is git log no longer enough to find something?
No problem, you've got this! Just learn a few Git tricks with me that got me out of a tight spot more than once - they can help you too.
I'll talk about rebase, shallow clone, submodules and bisect. Master Git and unleash your potential.
