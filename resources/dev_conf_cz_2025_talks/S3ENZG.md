## Abstract
                    
It often starts with a lonely Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole deployed via manual SSH commands. Then you buy an Intel NUC to host Jellyfin, deployed with Ansible. Finally, you find yourself with a rack at home running multiple Kubernetes clusters with a full GitOps setup.

Whether you’re already on the self-hosting/homelab journey or just considering starting it, you are invited to our meetup! We will talk about our hardware setups, software stacks, and all the fun we have with them.

Last year's concept of a series of lighning talks was a success, so let's do it again! If you'd like to give a 10-minute talk on any homelab/self-hosting topic, please contact me via email (ondrej(at)budai(dot).cz) or Matrix (@obudai:fedora.im).
