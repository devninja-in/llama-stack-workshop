## Abstract
                    
Last year, bootc containers (https://github.com/containers/bootc) were one of the most interesting and promising projects that offered a new way to manage and standardize your OS deployment and upgrades using container images. It has been a game-changer.

Now that the technology has settled in, itâ€™s time to see how it is evolving and how implementations and integrations have progressed over the months.

During this session, we will:

- Explore the evolution of this amazing technology and its current state of the art
- Analyze and discuss the upcoming news and good practices
- Discover what the ideal use cases are and how it is being adopted
- See in action how it can be integrated into build workflows and how to manage fleets of bootc-based devices with a short demo
