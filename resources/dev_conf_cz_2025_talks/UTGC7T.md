## Abstract
                    
In 2024, inspired by the Mass Open Cloud (MOC), and in collaboration with the MOC Alliance (MOC-A), Red Hat Waterford and the Walton Institute at SETU collaborated and partnered in establishing an experimental cloud for researchers, staff and students in both organisations. These are the first steps in extending the MOC-A into Europe. Already, this private/public sector collaboration has created a community of new OpenShift and RHEL users with bare metal access. It has been made possible by recycling a super computer, installed in the liquid cooled Walton data centre, with operations provided by SETU, tech support for the ops team provided by Red Hat, and initial testing by the RH-OCTO team in Waterford. Positive interest around the project has attracted additional infrastructure in the form of storage funded by SETU, and an IBM Z LinuxONE mainframe.
