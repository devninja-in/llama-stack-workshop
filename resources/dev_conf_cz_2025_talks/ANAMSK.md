## Abstract
                    
Contributor experience can make or break an open-source project. This talk explores how AI and automation are transforming the contribution workflow by offering personalized onboarding, automating changeset creation, and providing real-time feedback. With AI-powered PR review tools, custom bots, and workflow automation, projects can lower the barrier to entry, improve engagement, and streamline collaboration. We'll showcase real-world examples of how AI-driven solutions—like intelligent review assistants, automated issue triaging, and interactive onboarding bots—are making open source more accessible and efficient for both newcomers and maintainers.
