## Abstract
                    
The Linux ecosystem thrives on collaboration, yet distribution-specific tooling often creates silos. Packit, originally designed as a CI/CD solution for Fedora, is now bridging these gaps by expanding support to other distributions. Thanks to contributions from Google Summer of Code, Packit now integrates with the Open Build Service (OBS), bringing seamless automation to openSUSE and beyond.
In this talk, we’ll explore how OBS integration unlocks new capabilities for openSUSE developers and demonstrate how Packit streamlines package maintenance and CI/CD workflows across distributions. Whether you're a Fedora maintainer, an openSUSE contributor, or an upstream developer looking to automate your builds, you'll gain practical insights into Packit's growing toolset and how it can enhance your workflow.
Join us to see how Packit is breaking down barriers and making cross-distro CI/CD a reality!
