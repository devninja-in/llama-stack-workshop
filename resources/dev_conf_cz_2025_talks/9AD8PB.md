## Abstract
                    
üåç Did you know that over a billion people worldwide experience some form of disability? Visually impaired users struggle with unreadable content, keyboard-only users get trapped in broken navigation, and many face barriers that prevent them from accessing essential services. Yet, 97% of the world's top websites remain inaccessible, and many developers struggle with implementing accessibility due to unawareness, complexity, or time constraints. Ever wondered how AI can help make accessibility easier and more efficient?

In this hands-on workshop, we‚Äôll demystify web accessibility and explore how Generative AI (GenAI) and prompt engineering can empower developers to evaluate, enhance and automate accessibility. 
Whether you're a professional web developer or just interested in web development or AI prompt engineering, this workshop is for you!

We'll start from ground zero with a brief overview of web accessibility and its principles, including the WCAG guidelines. We will also discuss who is it for and how developers can evaluate how accessible their websites are. We‚Äôll walk through solutions together to write accessible web applications. Attendees will gain insights into crafting effective prompts to guide AI tools in producing accessible, standards-compliant code snippets.

Key highlights of this workshop include:
1. Hands-on Demo: Evaluating Website Accessibility using dev tools & Lighthouse.
2. Live Exercise: Prompt Engineering for Accessible Development.

Overall, we hope you will leave feeling empowered with basic web accessibility knowledge and the tools to aid your web accessibility journey‚Äîone accessible feature at a timeüöÄ.
