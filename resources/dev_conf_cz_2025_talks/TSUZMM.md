## Abstract
                    
Would you rather roll a dice when you are asked to estimate something? Well, perhaps that's the right way to go!
Einstein thought that God doesn't play dice, but today we know that he was wrong in a way. And I will show you that even a Perfect Estimators have to play dice when doing their job.
This talk will explore various scenarios in which a hypothetical Perfect Estimator is asked to estimate tasks, and we take a look which strategies lead to best results, and how properties of Story Points, Velocity and Fibonacci sequence interact.
It may be that what you consider to be a messy and random process is in fact very close to a perfect estimation.
