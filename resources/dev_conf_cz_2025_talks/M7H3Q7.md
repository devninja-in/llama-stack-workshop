## Abstract
                    
How to get started contributing to open source? Participating in open source projects is fun, meaningful, looks good on a CV, and can open doors. And documentation is often cited as the perfect way to become involved in open source. However, for the uninitiated, it can be intimidating. Where to look? Who to ask? Which project to choose? What issue to pick?

In this talk, Robert will present how the Open Documentation Academy makes the first steps in open source easier. Attendees will hear how the Academy works, how it provides guidance and support, and what lessons its organizers learned. You'll also be invited to get involved -- as mentors, aspiring contributors, or projects in need of docs.
