## Abstract
                    
Web components are a widespread and proven technology for developing browser-native UIs. A number of new and upcoming features like import attributes, reference targets, and declarative custom elements make web components even more attractive as a part of your front end stack. In this talk we'll explore some of those new APIs from a web development, accessibility, and architectural perspective and see how they help your community, open source project, or organization improve performance and accessibility, reduce development time, avoid costly technical debt, and boost engineering talent. If you are a **developer**, **project manager**, or **technology recruiter**, this talk will inform you about the state of the art in front-end web technologies.
