## Abstract
                    
Accessibility (a11y) ensures that websites and apps are usable by all people, including those with disabilities. It is often an afterthought in software development, this often results in expensive fixes later and makes the product difficult or impossible for some people to use. This talk will focus on an "accessibility-first" approach—integrating a11y considerations into design, development, and testing from the beginning. We will cover best practices, real-world case studies, and tools that help developers build inclusive applications that cater to diverse user needs.

This talk will cover:

Why accessibility matters – from ethical, legal, and business perspectives.
Common accessibility barriers – such as poor color contrast, missing alt text, lack of keyboard navigation, and screen reader incompatibility.
Practical steps for developers – simple coding practices, tools, and testing methods to integrate accessibility from the start.
By designing with accessibility in mind from day one, we create more inclusive, user-friendly, and future-proof products.
