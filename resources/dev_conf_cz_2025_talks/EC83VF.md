## Abstract
                    
Imagine a world where engineers and technical writers work in harmony: no last-minute documentation rushes, no outdated guides, no silos. Just one strong team working toward a shared goal.

Well, we can't promise you that perfect world. But we can share success stories and best practices that have helped us get closer:

* Documentation-inclusive shift left – Documentation teams are involved from the start, writers and engineers working side-by-side.
* Docs-driven testing – Documentation defines user workflows, enabling quality engineers to create tests based on real user behavior.
* Docs-as-code – Writers and engineers use the same tools and workflows, making collaboration smoother and more efficient.
* And more

As technical writers, we have worked in teams where documentation was not an afterthought but had a seat at the table from the very beginning. The result? Everyone benefits in the end: writers, developers, quality engineers, and most importantly, users.

Join us as we share lessons learned – both good and bad – to help you set the right expectations within your team and refine team processes. All to help you build better projects together.
