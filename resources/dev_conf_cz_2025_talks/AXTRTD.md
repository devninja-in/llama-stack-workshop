## Abstract
                    
Retrieval Augmented Generation models have the constant necessity to be updated when there are changes in the source of information. In order to keep the model delivering good answers it is important to set a up procedure to refresh its knowledge. This can be done by hand for a proof of concept project but for bigger projects we should set up a pipeline to automate this process. In this lighting talk I am going to explain how it is possible to create a Tekton pipeline to feed your RAG model with new updates, as well as, make this pipeline reusable and use it to ingest data into different RAG models.
