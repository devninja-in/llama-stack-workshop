## Abstract
                    
In 2022, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, a revelation that prompted reevaluating my approach to open-source contributions. However, instead of marking the end of my journey, it led to a rebirth, reshaping my strategies and perspectives. This talk will be a deep dive into the transformative adaptations I made and how these changes kept me active in the open-source community, drove my personal growth, and strengthened my contributions.

The session will focus on:

* The art of prioritization: The importance of focusing on a select few projects, ensuring quality contributions over quantity.

* Leaning on collaboration: How sharing the load and collaborating with peers can lead to innovative solutions and reduce the individual burden.

* The renewed emphasis on work-life balance: Taking a step back to ensure mental and physical well-being while keeping the passion for open-source alive.

By sharing my story, I hope to inspire others navigating similar challenges and emphasize that, with the proper adjustments, one can continue to thrive and contribute meaningfully to the open-source world.
