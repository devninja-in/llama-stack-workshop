## Abstract
                    
Every year, manufacturers produce 1.5 billion smartphones worldwide - and unfortunately, probably just as many are thrown away after what is usually a far too short hardware lifespan. E-waste increases every year. The energy required to produce the devices is extremely high, and the manufacturing and supply chain spans the globe several times. With Upcycling Android we address the problem by extending the hardware lifespan of phones and Android devices in particular!

With this workshop we want to give everybody the opportunity to flash a custom ROM to a device. We will provide some devices to flash and a live system with all needed parts installed. If you want to try out flashing a device, please bring your own notebook (with 8G or more of memory).
