## Abstract
                    
According to a recent report by The Guardian, "Diversity and inclusion initiatives are being scaled back or abandoned by companies due to economic pressures and political pushback" (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/16/diversity-inclusion-initiatives-scaled-back-companies-economic-pressures-political-pushback). This alarming trend threatens corporate and workforce agility, as companies struggle to maintain a diverse and inclusive work environment.

The problem manifests itself in the form of decreased employee engagement, reduced innovation, and lower productivity. Companies that abandon DEI initiatives risk losing top talent and facing reputational damage.

The root cause of this problem is the lack of a strategic approach to DEI, making it vulnerable to economic and political pressures. Companies often view DEI as a "nice-to-have" rather than a business imperative.

This talk will provide a framework for companies to integrate DEI into their core business strategy, ensuring agility and resilience in the face of economic and political uncertainty.

Attendees will gain three key takeaways: (1) the business case for DEI, (2) strategies for integrating DEI into core business operations, and (3) best practices for measuring DEI impact.

Join us to learn how to safeguard your company's agility and future-proof your workforce.
