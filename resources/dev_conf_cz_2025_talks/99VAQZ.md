## Abstract
                    
What does it take to bring an animatronic creature to life? This session explores the development of an interactive animatronic raven, focusing on the engineering, coding, and motion synchronization techniques that drive its lifelike behavior. 
Throughout the build process, I tackled key challenges in audio-to-motion mapping, servo calibration, and creating randomized behavior to ensure the movements felt more natural and less robotic. The session will walk through how these systems were developed and coded, with a hands-on breakdown of real-time audio processing, embedded system control, behavioral logic, and AI driven face recognition for interactive animatronics.
Attendees will gain practical insights into animatronics, audio-driven robotics, and hands-on Python development for Raspberry Pi. Whether you're a robotics enthusiast, an animatronics developer, a creative coding hobbyist, or a Frankenstein enthusiast, this talk offers a behind-the-scenes exploration of the code, hardware, and problem-solving strategies that brought this animatronic raven to life.
