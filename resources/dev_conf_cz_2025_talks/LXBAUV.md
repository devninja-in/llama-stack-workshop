## Abstract
                    
Use After Free (UAF) vulnerabilities are a stealthy and dangerous type of memory management flaw that can lead to severe security breaches. When a program continues to use memory after it has been freed, it opens the door to unexpected behavior, crashes, and even remote code execution. These vulnerabilities are particularly prevalent in memory-unsafe languages like C or C++ and can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious code or access sensitive data.
 
In this talk, we will explore the root causes of UAF vulnerabilities, how they can be exploited (with demos) and the best practices to prevent them to safeguard your applications and ensure robust security.
