## Abstract
                    
Quantum computers look to eventually break all our existing public key algorithms. NIST has creates new replacement algorithms for key exchange and signatures. These new algorithms include new primitives like Key Encryption Mechanisms (KEMS) that can be  built from either Key Exchange Algorithms (KEX) or Key Encryption Algorithms (KEA). Signatures now include primitives that require the signature before the hash verification starts. This talk walks through these new ideas, now PKCS #11 handles them and how they new algorithms actually work.
