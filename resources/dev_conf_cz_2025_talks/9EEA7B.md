## Abstract
                    
Backstage developed by Spotify is an open-source framework for building developer portals. It provides a centralized software catalog that restores order to your infrastructure and empowers teams to ship high-quality code efficiently. But how do you go from zero to a fully functional developer portal?

In this hands-on workshop, we will guide you through standing up Backstage from scratch, configuring it, and preparing it for real-world use. Attendees will get practical experience in:

Installing Backstage and understanding its core architecture.
Configuring PostgreSQL, authentication, and integrations.
Adding software components to the catalog.
Preparing Backstage for production deployment.

By the end of this session, you will have a standing Backstage instance with working integrations, setting you up for success in building a powerful Internal Developer Platform (IDP). Whether you're a developer, DevOps engineer, or platform team member, this workshop will provide actionable insights into customizing and scaling Backstage in your organization.
