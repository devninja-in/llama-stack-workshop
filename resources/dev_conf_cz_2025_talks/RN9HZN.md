## Abstract
                    
eBPF allows to safely attach small programs in the Linux Kernel and inspect the runtime memory of the Kernel and userspace programs at runtime. This opens a wide range of possibilities for observability applications. However, the low-level approach of eBPF often makes it difficult to match the inspected data with high-level concepts, such as the entities in your Kubernetes cluster.
This talk describes our journey to make Kubernetes a first-class citizen in Grafana Beyla, our eBPF-based instrumentation tool. From a hacker perspective, we will describe how we did to match the low-level abstractions from eBPF with the high-level Kubernetes information, in order to provide a unified experience by fuzzing the barriers between application, platform and infrastructure. We designed Beyla to be ubiquitous, so it can run as a simple operating-system-level process that internally understands about processes. But we wanted our Kubernetes users to keep talking about Pods, Deployments, and Services, so they donâ€™t have to change their mindset nor have to dig into the lower-level constructions of the operating system to keep using Beyla.
