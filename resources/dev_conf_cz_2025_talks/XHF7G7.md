## Abstract
                    
Career progression is often seen through the narrow lens of promotions and title changes, but is that really the only way forward? In this session, we’ll challenge traditional career thinking and explore alternative paths to advancement, focusing on your personal goals and motivations.

We’ll discuss:
- How to rethink career growth and take a proactive role in shaping your development
- The difference between career growth and promotions – and why it matters
- How cultural and organizational factors influence your career trajectory
- The role of managers, mentors, and peers in shaping your development
- How to make your impact visible and navigate career decisions with clarity

Rather than giving simple answers, this talk will help you reflect on the right questions to critically assess your career goals and take ownership of your professional growth.
