## Abstract
                    
Teams have a real pressure to decrease time to market. However, how can we deliver with confidence, i.e. ship faster without sacrificing quality?

In this meetup, we will brainstorm strategies for balancing speed and quality in software development. Share your tips, learn from peers, and discover solutions around:

- Reducing bottlenecks.
- "Shifting left", implementing testing and automation early and often.
- Avoiding silos.
- Fostering a shared understanding and ownership of quality.
- Using metrics to identify areas for improvement and track progress.

Your insights are key! Let's learn from each other and collaborate to build better software, faster :)
