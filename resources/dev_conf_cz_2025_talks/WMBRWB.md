## Abstract
                    
There’s an exciting potential for bootable containers, which allow you to build and manage a full operating system just like a container image, and recently, Red Hat announced it’s intention to donate the tool to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). However, for AI/ML workloads which require a complicated stack of dependencies, this technology helps curate the delivery of a full stack for training and inferencing, for example with Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI. Join us as we put together an operating system for running an AI-enabled application with CentOS Stream, using an InstructLab fine-tuned model from our local developer workstation. With bootable containers, our deployment workflow is simplified, with flexibility for dynamic requirements and environments in building the next generation of Linux workloads.
