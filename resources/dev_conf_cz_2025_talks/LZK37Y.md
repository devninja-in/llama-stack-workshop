## Abstract
                    
My dog loved sitting on the sofa when we weren’t home, and when we bought a new one, I wanted to keep it fur-free. That simple need led me down the rabbit hole of smart home automation. I researched sensors, connected them to a Zigbee hub, and built an automated deterrent system. But I didn’t stop there.
Once I had the setup running, I started tackling other household challenges—automating the AC, water heater, and even nighttime lights. Each challenge pushed me to explore new devices, protocols, and integrations, eventually turning my home into a truly smart environment.
In this talk, I’ll share my journey from a single problem to a full-fledged smart home, the technical aspects of setting it up, and key lessons learned. Whether you’re new to home automation or already experimenting, this session will inspire you to solve everyday problems with sensors, automation, and a little bit of creativity.
