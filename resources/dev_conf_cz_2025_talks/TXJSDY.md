## Abstract
                    
In this session, it will be demonstrated a streamlined method for setting up a home lab to develop and test Large Language Models (LLMs) using Podman AI Lab. The process begins with deploying and refining LLMs locally on a developer's workstation using InstructLab. Once these models are matured, it will be explained how to transition them seamlessly to OpenShift AI using a local OpenShift cluster setup or even a cloud sandbox instance. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to experiment with LLMs locally and scale to a production-ready environment.
