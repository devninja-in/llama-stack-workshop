## Abstract
                    
Switching from Kanban to Scrum can feel like moving from casual workouts to a structured training plan—more rules, more reps, and plenty of skepticism. When I started with the RHEL Lightspeed team, they saw Scrum as extra overhead with unclear benefits. My role? Like a strength coach, I helped them build solid foundations, focus on form over speed, and progressively overload their Agile practices—one sprint at a time.

But just like in strength training, real progress didn’t come from adding more—it came from adding the right things at the right time. Instead of forcing Scrum, we built it from the ground up, refining fundamentals, adapting based on feedback, and celebrating small wins.

This isn’t a talk about frameworks—it’s about transformation. Through real stories, I’ll share how trust, gradual change, and the right mindset turned Scrum from a burden into a competitive advantage. And yes, there will be weightlifting metaphors—because Agile, like strength training, is all about consistency, adaptation, and getting stronger over time.
