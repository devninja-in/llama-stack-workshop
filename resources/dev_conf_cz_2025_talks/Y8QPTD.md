## Abstract
                    
The rise of AI is transforming software development, but building AI applications still requires extensive setup and knowledge of frameworks, pipelines, and best practices. What if you could skip the tedious setup and jump straight into AI development?

Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH), an internal developer platform built on Backstage, simplifies the development experience by consolidating essential tools and processes into a single portal. One of its most powerful features is software templates, which allow teams to scaffold AI applications quickly and consistently.

In this talk, we'll explore:

The role of RHDH in modern developer productivity.
How software templates can scaffold AI applications.
A live demo of using RHDH to deploy AI-powered applications (e.g., Chatbots, RAG applications, AI-enhanced code generators).
How AI templates integrate with Red Hat OpenShift AI for scalable model deployment.

Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a platform engineer, or a developer looking to streamline your workflow, this session will showcase how RHDH can accelerate AI development in your organization.
