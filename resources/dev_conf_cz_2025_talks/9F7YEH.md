## Abstract
                    
Now that RHEL starts being targeted for connected car environments, there is the
opportunity to make CAN subsystem adopt the latest refinements that other
networking components got recently. This includes observability, test coverage,
documentation: in this talk we are going to briefly survey what has been done
in the past months and what we are planning for the future.
