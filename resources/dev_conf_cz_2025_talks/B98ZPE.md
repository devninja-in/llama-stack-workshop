## Abstract
                    
You want to test your web page or web app, or just automate downloading your daily comic? WebDriver BiDi is an upcoming W3C standard for browser automation adopted by Firefox, Chromium, and in the future Webkit/Safari. It requires only your already installed browser and python-aiohttp, websocat, or anything else that can speak JSON over a websocket. No need to install npm, selenium, modified browser builds, complicated frameworks, or other moving parts.

Martin explains how easy and pleasant browser automation has become today, gives a live demo with simple interactive command line tools, and some pointers to documentation and re-usable code to get started.
