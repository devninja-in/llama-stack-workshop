## Abstract
                    
Since 2020, there has been a significant rise not only in threats to our health but also in **cyberattacks, which have surged by 105%**. A majority of these **attacks have targeted the frontend**, impacting everyone from major brands to everyday individuals. Such breaches can compromise your brand identity, erode user trust, and expose **sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, leading to severe reputational and financial damage. This talk will focus on the most prevalent attacks faced globally and how secure coding practices can help safeguard against them while preserving your brand's integrity and protecting your users.

Key Highlights:
----------------------------------
**XSS Attack**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) exploits vulnerabilities in web applications to inject malicious scripts, enabling attackers to steal sensitive data or hijack user sessions.

**Iframe Injection**: An attack where malicious iframes are embedded into a webpage, redirecting users to malicious sites or stealing sensitive data.

**CSRF Attack**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tricks authenticated users into performing unintended actions on a trusted website, compromising account security or executing unauthorized transactions.

Why Attend?
-------------------------------------
