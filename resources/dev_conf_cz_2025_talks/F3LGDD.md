## Abstract
                    
Shared Memory Communications over RDMA (SMC-R) protocol provides Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) communications to TCP endpoints in a manner that is transparent to socket applications.
In the presentation I am going to make a brief overview of two SMC protocols SMC-D and SMC-R, explain the difference between them, their advantages and disadvantages.
I will also share my experience of implementing SMC-R protocol in Software-defined storage (SDS) on IBM Linux on Z platform, provide SMC-R performance evaluation in comparison with SMC-D and TCP.
During the talk we will also discuss the possible bottlenecks of SMC-R protocol with the references to its implementation in Linux kernel.
And finally, you will learn how to enable SMC sockets in any application.
