## Abstract
                    
As automation becomes ever more important, safe and secure management of secrets is paramount. It is vital that secrets are managed in a secure, centralized manner and that control is thus maintained over them. In this session we will explore the integration of Ansible with Conjur Open Source, and how this lends itself perfectly to secure, centralized secrets management. As a bonus, we'll even explore how Conjur Open Source can be used in a wider context to provide secrets to other platforms, and even rotation of credentials on a Linux server can be managed.
