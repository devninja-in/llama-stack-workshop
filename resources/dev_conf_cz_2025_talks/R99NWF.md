We're excited to announce that there will be a social event held during the conference. We invite all speakers, volunteers, and attendees to join us on Friday evening. **You will need your conference badge to enter.**

The social event is held outdoors near the swimming pool. Please note, we do not plan to use the swimming pool for a variety of reasons. We chose the place because it is located conveniently and there is a beautiful outdoor deck that can create the right atmosphere for us. We will have access to beach volleyball courts and we have prepared other outdoor games for your enjoyment during the social event.
