## Abstract
                    
Do you have a favorite open source project that you use everyday? And now be honest, as a user, have you ever contributed to it? No?

For many, contributing to open source feels synonymous with writing code. During this talk, I would like to encourage both users and maintainers to start thinking about it differently. I'll share tips on how we as users can help project maintainers with increasing awareness of the projects and building better community by providing feedback, writing or presenting about our experience, or suggesting a small improvement of documentation.
