## Abstract
                    
In the era of digital transformation and the adoption of cloud native technologies, organizations running large scale deployments encounter a significant challenge in modernizing their legacy applications to fully leverage the benefits of cloud native technologies.

Konveyor project introduces "Kai", an open-source tool that uses generative AI to accelerate application modernization. Kai integrates large language models (LLMs, you can bring your own) with static code analysis to facilitate code modifications within a developer's IDE, helps transition to other modern programming languages and frameworks efficiently.

Attendees will get hints on how Kai accelerates refactoring legacy Java application to run on Kubernetes.
