## Abstract
                    
Database Operations Team now utilizes an AI-driven self-service system where the AI acts as the approval authority for temporary sysadmin access to MS SQL Servers. This system has replaced the previous manual process, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. With hundreds of requests annually, challenges such as inappropriate requests, pressure for expedited approvals, and missing information have been addressed. The AI-driven system enhances efficiency by reducing approval times, ensures consistency through standardized criteria, mitigates risks by analyzing historical data and user behavior, and scales to accommodate growing request volumes. This approach delivers faster, more reliable, and scalable access management.
