## Abstract
                    
A short demo of using Packit and Fedora Testing Farm for testing, development and release automation in a medium sized upstream project.

Storaged project uses Packit for doing nightly builds, running tests on upstream pull requests and for downstream (Fedora) build automation which includes reverse dependency testing not only across our project, but also includes some of the users of our API. In this talk I will show Packit makes this all possible and in fact very easy in a way accessible to every open source project.
