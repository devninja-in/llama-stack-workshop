## Abstract
                    
The Fediverse is a decentralised social network. But what does that mean?

In this talk I will give a short introduction to the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) of 2025 and how it started to evolve in 2008. I will explain the basic concepts of ActivityPub as the protocol of the Fediverse and how the use of this open protocol has enabled a diverse group of Free Software projects to build a social network of (micro) blogging, video streaming, podcasting and event organizing. A network of thousands of community hosted services, where users can share and interact with each other regardless of the platform they use. What is possible in the Fediverse of 2025? And how can you get started today?

This talk does not require any technical knowledge of the Fediverse. However, you should know what an email is.
