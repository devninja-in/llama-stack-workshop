## Abstract
                    
Mentorship can be a real game-changer for both mentors and mentees.
I've experienced it myself, and in this lightning talk, I'll share some practical tips I've learned along the way from being on both sides of the table. For mentees, I’ll suggest you how to prepare, ask the questions that actually matter, and avoid wasting time so you can make the most of every session. For mentors, I’ll encourage you to overcome self-doubt and realize that your experiences, no matter how small they may seem, can inspire and empower others. Mentorship is about growth, connection, and allyship. Let’s explore how we can all step up, support each other, and create opportunities to grow together!
