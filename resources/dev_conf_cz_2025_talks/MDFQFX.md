## Abstract
                    
The Ansible code bot scans existing content collections, roles, and playbooks hosted in GitHub repositories, and proactively creates pull requests whenever best practices or quality improvement recommendations are available. The bot automatically submits pull requests to the repository, which proactively alerts the repository owner to a recommended change to their content . You can configure Ansible code bot to scan your existing Git repositories (both public and private).
