## Abstract
                    
Picture this: Your staging environment is constantly failing due to too many users deploying their latest features. Data is disorganized, and engineers often find themselves waiting in line to use it. The instability is hindering progress, and you're asked to find a way to unblock the team by creating isolated environments for testing and deployment. But with dozens of microservices in play, this task feels overwhelming.

How can you create developer environments in an infrastructure that deploys such a large number of services? And is it possible to do this in an affordable and scalable way?

In this intermediate-to-advanced talk, we will present Alfred, our solution for triggering developer environments in a chaotic microservice ecosystem by treating them as canary releases using a service mesh. This talk is tailored for DevOps and infrastructure engineers who want to tackle the complexity of managing multiple dev environments in a scalable and cost-effective way.

Don’t be fooled by its charming name—Alfred is an opinionated butler that knows your services and workflows. It takes care of your managed databases for dev environments and works seamlessly with your mesh solution to enable affordable, scalable developer environments for your engineering team.
