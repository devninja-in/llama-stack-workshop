## Abstract
                    
Llama stack has become the new talk of the town in the open source AI community. But what exactly is Llama Stack and how to leverage it to build real-world AI applications ? Llama stack is a framework for streamlining development of AI apps. Developers face multiple challenges in building the AI apps such as handling the infrastructure complexity, using different tooling for the essential capabilities like knowledge retrieval, RAG, monitoring, evaluation etc. and lastly the lack of flexibility and choices for provider integrations. In this workshop, we will understand how Llama stack addresses these challenges and standardizes the core building blocks for simplifying AI application development.

In this workshop, the attendees will get to learn the following - 

- What is Llama stack and how it addresses developer challenges ?
- What are the advantages of using llama stack ?
- Understand the Llama stack components and APIs.
- How to setup Llama stack ?
- Hands-on with Llama stack - Building An App with Llama stack APIs. We will show how to build an AI app that can call two different tools and combine their results to give a final answer. Using Llama Stack and FastAPI, we will demonstrate how an AI agent interacts with tools like APIs to process information. It will be a Python project. Participants need to bring their laptops.

Whether you're an AI enthusiast or developer, this workshop will provide an introduction along with a hands-on session for leveraging the Llama Stack for your next project.
