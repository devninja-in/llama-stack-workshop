## Abstract
                    
What is the most distinctive skill of the senior engineer? Productive coding, fast learning, knowing tons of technologies or delivering shiny presentations? Well, not quite.

It is the ability to overcome problems others could not. To maintain the momentum instead of getting stuck. To progress when there are bumps on the road.

Join me introducing some of the universal concepts and approaches to help restore operation of modern systems.
