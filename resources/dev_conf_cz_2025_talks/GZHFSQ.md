## Abstract
                    
Traditional farming practices often struggle with inefficiencies, such as over-fertilisation, delayed pest detection, and reactive soil management, leading to reduced yields and environmental impact. 

AI-ready data spaces can transform agriculture, as shown by the Horizon Europe Green.Dat.AI research projectâ€™s smart farming optimisation pilot, which enables secure data exchange and real-time analytics via AI services. By integrating satellite imagery, drones, and in-situ sensors, the pilot delivers precision fertilisation, early pest detection, and predictive soil health assessments. Key innovations such as federated learning for privacy-preserving edge AI training, digital twins for optimised farm management, and anomaly detection for proactive decisions are harnessed within MyFarm, a widely used Slovenian platform supporting data-driven decision making for farmers and advisors. These advancements refine fertilisation, boost crop predictions, and enhance farm efficiency, paving the way for smarter, more resilient agriculture. 

Attendees will gain insights into the technical and practical aspects of implementing AI-driven solutions in agriculture, including challenges, best practices, and future opportunities for innovation.
