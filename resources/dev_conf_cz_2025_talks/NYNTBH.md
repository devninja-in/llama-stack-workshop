## Abstract
                    
Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) is a suite of shared libraries that enable the local system administrator to choose how individual service-providing applications perform authentication, authorization, and session management on Linux systems.

In this talk, we'll demystify PAM's core concepts and practical applications.
We'll explore how to leverage the PAM's dynamically configurable modular architecture to implement various authentication policies and customize session management to meet specific needs.
Through real-world examples and practical configuration insights, you'll learn how to troubleshoot PAM issues and understand the impact of PAM configuration changes.
