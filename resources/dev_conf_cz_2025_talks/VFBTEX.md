## Abstract
                    
Feeling overwhelmed by multiple backlogs and misaligned priorities? Struggling with fragmented communication and inefficiencies?
This problem arises because different teams often operate in silos, each with its own set of priorities and tracking systems. Imagine a scenario where project deadlines slip through the cracks, priorities clash and team efforts are duplicated or wasted. This isn't just hypothetical; it’s a reality for many (all?).
Enter the concept of a unified backlog—a single, prioritized list that aligns the work of 1, many or all teams. Sounds like a fairytale, right?
We can never claim our backlog is unified 100% (after all, it’s a constantly evolving process) the benefits can be substantial. It's also essential to recognize that a unified backlog means different things to different people, depending on their roles.
By integrating our efforts, we can conquer chaos, streamline our processes and drive better results across the board.
Join us as we delve into the advantages, disadvantages and pitfalls of a unified backlog.
