## Abstract
                    
In today’s fast-paced development environments, creating products that truly meet user needs can feel like a race against time. This hands-on workshop will equip you with powerful strategies to increase your success rate in delivery through user-centered design. We’ll explore the Möbius Loop—a continuous, dynamic approach that redefines how feedback and iteration fuel product success. You’ll learn how this simple concept connects directly to user-centered design principles. 

Through an interactive challenge—designing an alarm clock for people with disabilities—you’ll work in groups where real users become facilitators, shifting your perspective from assumptions to actual needs. This collaborative approach will sharpen your ability to empathize, ideate, and iterate effectively.

Whether you’re a designer, developer, or product leader, you’ll leave with actionable insights on how to apply user-centered design in any project, boost delivery success, and create products that are useful, intuitive, and enjoyable.
