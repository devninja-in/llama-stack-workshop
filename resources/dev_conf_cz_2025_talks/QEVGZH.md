## Abstract
                    
Do you love coffee? Do you enjoy trying new beans or experimenting with different brewing methods? If yes, we would be happy to meet new friends during [DevConf.cz](https://www.devconf.info/cz/) that have the same hobby as we have!

Letâ€™s meet, brew some coffee together and exchange our tips and tricks about coffee.

We'll bring some of the beans we love and make a lot of coffee using various methods (V60, Aeropress, Moka, French Press etc.). If you have your favorite coffee beans or method you want to show your coffee friends during DevConf.cz, we encourage you to bring it to this meetup as well!
