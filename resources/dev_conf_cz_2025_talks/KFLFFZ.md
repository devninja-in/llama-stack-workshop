## Abstract
                    
This talk will show can we use Makefiles for quick generation of artifacts, but shows the unreadibility caveats that long Makefiles will quickly expose, and in which case it makes sense to consider a slow but more maintainable approach like Ansible Playbooks.
For projects which are rarely updated, it makes sense to use something slow at runtime, but easy to update, especially if the project code is run infrequently.

We will discuss this using two community projects. The talk will also touch how LLM based code assistants relate to those trade offs.

Target Audience are sysadmin, devops.
