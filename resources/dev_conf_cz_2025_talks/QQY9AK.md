## Abstract
                    
Within an event-driven, microservices architecture there's often a big gap between a web component that relies on some data, and the event data itself. There will usually be several services in the middle, from multiple APIs, databases, distributed caches etc. Building and updating that web component might mean touching many codebases and coordinating across many teams. This can be slow and hamper experimentation. What if... we bring that raw event data right into the browser, making it, in effect "event driven"? That web component can be developed and iterated on at lightning speed. New components can be built without the need for new endpoints. With access to the raw data, frontend developers suddenly have the freedom to explore new, bold ideas without fear of the upstream complexity.
