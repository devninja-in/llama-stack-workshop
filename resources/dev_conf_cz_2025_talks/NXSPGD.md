## Abstract
                    
In this interactive workshop, participants will embark on an AWS Gameday to explore the capabilities of OpenShift Virtualization on Red Hat Openshift on AWS. Through a series of hands-on exercises, you'll learn how it is possible to leverage this powerful feature of Red Hat OpenShift to migrate, manage, and modernize virtual infrastructure. Throughout the Gameday, you'll navigate challenges such as importing existing VMs, updating Linux and Windows VMs, configuring networking and storage, and performing live migrations.
