## Abstract
                    
Over the last few years, the Telco space has seen a great amount of change in the way their workloads are deployed. Starting from purpose-built hardware appliances, they evolved into virtualized network functions, and now containerized network functions (CNFs).

Some of these containerized network functions are deployed on the Far Edge, away from a centralized datacenter, and come with their ownset of requirements and challenges for a successful implementation.

In this session, we will highlight the areas where CNFs add special requirements to Kubernetes/OpenShift, and the strategies put in place to tackle these challenges in real-life deployments.

Some of the topics we will cover:

- Overview of CNF-based RAN architecture
- Special requirements for Distributed Unit (DU) CNFs
- OpenShift functionality for Telco Edge deployments
- Reducing complexity for RAN deployments using a Reference Design Specification
- What’s next for RAN containerized deployments on the edge
