## Abstract
                    
OpenShift CI infrastructure has expanded year after year, requiring a shift from a few large clusters to a more agile network of smaller ones. This transition required the development of dynamic strategies for managing job reshuffling during outages, maintenance, and other disruptions. The presentation highlights this journey. Attendees will gain insights into how workload management can enhance scalability in multi-cluster environments by considering factors such as execution history, cluster capabilities, system architecture and more.
