## Abstract
                    
If 2024 was the year for Generative AI where terms such as prompting and LLMs were on everyone's mind, then 2025 might be the year for Quantum Computing. In this presentation I will give an introduction into Quantum computing and give practical examples on how and where this technology can be applied. After this session you should have a good understanding of Quantum Computing and how it can be applied to generate business value.
