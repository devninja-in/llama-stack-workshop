## Abstract
                    
DEI work is often seen as abstract and despites lots of good will, volunteers seems to struggle to find something impactful in free software communities due to the gap between the type of work required to improve diversity and the type of work produced by the community members.

In this talk, I will detail one of the effort started by the Fedora DEI team around username change and how by offering a technical activity impacting under represneted folks (mostly women, trans people, but others too), we aim to close the aformentioned gap and bring new members in the community.
