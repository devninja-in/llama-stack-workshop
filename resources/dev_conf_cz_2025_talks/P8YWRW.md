## Abstract
                    
As Linux distributions power everything from enterprise servers to edge devices, efficient troubleshooting and proactive issue detection become critical for system reliability. Traditional debugging methods often involve manually sifting through logs, running diagnostic commands, and analyzing system state—an approach that is time-consuming and reactive.

In this talk, we explore two complementary open-source frameworks that streamline Linux diagnostics: Insights-Core and SOS. While both target key components such as the kernel, networking, storage, and system services, they serve distinct roles in the diagnostic lifecycle.

Insights-Core powers proactive issue detection through lightweight, rule-based analysis of regularly collected system data.

SOS supports reactive diagnostics, offering in-depth system snapshots that aid in root cause analysis during incident response.

Key takeaways from this session:
How Insights-Core rules detect risks and misconfigurations before they escalate
How SOS captures comprehensive diagnostics to support deep investigation
Real-world use cases across systemd services, networking, kernel, and security
Best practices for extending Insights-Core with custom rules

This session will explain how these tools help system administrators, SREs, and support engineers quickly diagnose Linux issues—without manual intervention.
