## Abstract
                    
The Java platform experiences an outburst of cool new features â€“ new features added to the Java language include multi-line string literals, simple data carriers and pattern matching. Many library and Java Virtual Machine features were added as well, including virtual threads and an ability to interconnect Java and native code. Many more features are in the pipeline and are actively worked on. This includes value classes for the Java virtual machine and improvements to the pattern matching for Java. These features are delivered quickly, thanks to the recently adopted, predictable, six-months schedule of major Java SE releases. This new release cadence means new Java platform features are delivered twice every year!

In this talk, we will show a live demo of many of the recently added and newly developed features and improvements for the Java platform.
