## Abstract
                    
Large Kubernetes clusters can generate significant volumes of logs, especially when housing thousands of running pods. This may demand substantial CPU, RAM, disk IO, and disk space for storing and querying large log volumes. In this talk, we will look into different strategies of storing those logs in ElasticSearch, Grafana Loki and VictoriaLogs and examine how we can save 10x or more on infrastructure costs.

This talk presents real-world examples of efficient log management in large-scale Kubernetes clusters. It includes setup demonstrations, numerical data, and graphical representations from reproducible benchmarks.
