## Abstract
                    
In this hands-on session, we’ll focus on transforming a React Native app from using mocked data to fully utilizing cloud services like authentication, real-time data, file storage and generative AI. Through live coding, we’ll demonstrate how to create your infrastructure and connect your application to AWS services. By the end of this talk, you’ll have the skills to implement secure authentication, cloud-based data, storage, and add AI functionality to your mobile apps, enabling you to take your React Native projects to the next level.
