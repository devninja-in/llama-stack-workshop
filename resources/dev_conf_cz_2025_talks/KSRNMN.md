## Abstract
                    
An innocent-looking bicycle crash slowly evolves into a health situation that eventually results in a life-saving cranial surgery. What does this have to do with management in technology?
A lot, actually. This talk will introduce the audience to some of the analogies and lessons learnt that can be re-applied in our business as well. A few points that we will cover:
- We are treating hearts here, not heads - How a siloed organisation can kill you(r business)
- First we deal with the blood pressure, if it doesn't help, you will see a neurologist - Why fishbone RCAs are more effective than using the linear 5-Whys technique
- Listen to that headache and respond to it - Why is it essential for survival to have your alerts, SLOs and SOPs defined
- Let's just put all those medical check results on the table - Why mapping knowns and unknowns is an effective problem solving method
- If it's unlikely, we are not looking into it, is that right? - Why a three-dimensional risk management approach that also focuses on 'What we can do against it' is more effective than focusing only on probability and impact
- AI + worried wife = accurate diagnosis - Great ideas can come from anybody (including LLMs)
