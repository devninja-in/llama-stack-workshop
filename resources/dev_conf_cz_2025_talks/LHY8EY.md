## Abstract
                    
In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the fusion of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. "Taranis AI: Pioneering AI-Driven OSINT" highlights the journey of developing a fully open-source OSINT platform while navigating the complexities of applied AI research. 

Building on the foundation of Taranis-NG and Taranis3, Taranis AI has embraced an open-source approach to enhance OSINT workflows with advanced AI technologies, including natural language processing (NLP) and AI-driven threat analysis.  

This session will dive into the critical technical and strategic decisions made during the development of Taranis AI, such as how we selected and trained machine learning models within the constraints of an open-source ecosystem. We will also explore how the open-source nature of the project invites collaboration, fosters innovation, and mitigates the typical bottlenecks faced when implementing AI in security. 

By sharing real-world use cases, weâ€™ll demonstrate the tangible impact Taranis AI is having on OSINT operations today and discuss the lessons learned from balancing cutting-edge AI advancements with the realities of open-source software development.
