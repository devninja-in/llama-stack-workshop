## Abstract
                    
Cynefin is a framework that helps people make decisions in complex situations. The framework was developed by Dave Snowden, a former leader at IBM, in the early 2000s. This session introduces a novel approach for understanding AI's impact on technology careers by mapping job displacement patterns to the Cynefin decision-making framework.

Rather than treating AI job disruption as a monolithic force, I'll demonstrate how job vulnerability and adaptation strategies differ dramatically depending on whether your work falls in the Clear, Complicated, Complex, or Chaotic domains. Attendees will gain practical, actionable strategies tailored to their specific domain and learn how to strategically position themselves as AI continues to transform the technology landscape.
This talk targets technology professionals at all career stages who are experiencing or anticipating AI disruption in their fields:

Software developers concerned about AI code generation tools
Data analysts watching AutoML platforms advance
IT operations specialists facing AIOps automation
Technology managers responsible for workforce planning
Tech professionals seeking to future-proof their careers
Career advisors and tech educators helping others navigate these changes


The talk positions the Cynefin framework as a powerful lens for understanding different patterns of AI job displacement and developing targeted adaptation strategies.
The talk would stand out from typical AI discussions by providing actionable, personalised guidance rather than general speculation about the future of work. It transforms a complex, anxiety-inducing topic into a structured approach for career resilience in an AI-augmented workplace.
