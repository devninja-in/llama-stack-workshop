## Abstract
                    
Welcome to this year's glibc dev workshop. Last year's edition brought half a dozen patches so it's definitely worth repeating this year, hopefully even better with some experience now under our belts. So roll up your sleeves and prepare to write your first (or maybe second) glibc patch with us.

This is going to be a beginner+ level workshop. You will need a Linux laptop with the necessary tools installed (I will provide details in advance), some understanding of git, and maybe a bit of comfort with C and Makefiles.

Like last year, we will work on picking some low hanging fruit, producing small, incremental improvements, and getting some new names (yours?) on the glibc commit log. We will fix typos, write docs, improve existing tests and add some new ones. Like last year, I will bring enough individual, clearly scoped, small problems at various difficult levels.

Experienced C hackers are also welcome. Perhaps you could fix a bug or three? I will bring some.

I will provide:
 * An introduction to glibc and its codebase
 * A list of well defined, small, individual problems for everyone to solve (some very easy)

Each willing participant will get a cheat-sheet with a problem description and pointers on how to approach it. I'll be around to help!
