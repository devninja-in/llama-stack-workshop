## Abstract
                    
Leadership is often thought of as a technical or process-driven skill, but at its core, it’s deeply human. Through my psychotherapy training journey, I discovered how understanding emotions, trauma, and human behavior profoundly impacted my ability to lead, mentor, and inspire others.

In this lightning talk, I’ll share how this experience helped me:

* Develop a deeper level of empathy to better understand team dynamics and individual struggles.
* Build self-confidence, which empowered me to navigate conflict and make tough decisions with clarity and composure.
* Improve the quality of my feedback by learning to frame challenges and opportunities in ways that resonate.
* Recognize and address underlying patterns (both in myself and others) that may hinder personal and team growth.

Drawing from personal stories—including over 20 sessions of holotropic breathwork and moments of self-discovery—I’ll also highlight how shifting my relationship with mistakes and perfectionism transformed my approach to mentoring.

This session will provide attendees with actionable insights on how focusing on emotional intelligence and self-awareness can make a tangible difference in the way they lead and connect with their teams.
