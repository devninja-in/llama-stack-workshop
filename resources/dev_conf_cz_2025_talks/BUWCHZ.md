## Abstract
                    
In the past year, we’ve noticed how open source language models have now met or even exceeded the capabilities of proprietary AI models. That’s fantastic, but how can you get started customizing a model of your own, to be an expert in whatever your use case might be? Traditionally it required extensive data science or ML engineering, more hardware than most of us will ever have, and highly structured datasets. But now, various open source projects have emerged to simplify the fine-tuning process, where we teach a model how to learn new tricks, saving costs, improving accuracy, and ensuring data privacy. 

We encourage developers, AI engineers, and all to join us in this workshop, where you’ll help 404 Airlines adopt generative AI through a domain-specific small language model. You’ll learn the fundamentals of model training and deployment, how to incorporate real-time data with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and model integration into a live application! Bring a laptop and let’s take flight, while using open source to customize and run our own language model.
